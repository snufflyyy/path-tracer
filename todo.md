# todo list

 - use a faster library for writing png files or use a fast zlib compress function (see std_image_write.h lines 17-21 for more info)
 - change shader to match how texture is, just a typedef
 - fix image exporting
 - switch to job system instead of camera's current mulit threaded approach (very slow bc of thread creation)
 - clean up the #includes
 - create random .h and .c
