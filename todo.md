# todo list

 - use a faster library for writing png files or use a fast zlib compress function (see std_image_write.h lines 17-21 for more info)
 - create some sort of logging subsystem that lets me log errors
 - optimize the Color to ColorRGB to be as fast as possible
 - change shader to match how texture is, just a typedef
 - it might be wise to just go fully into the imgui for everything, i could use imgui to display the framebuffer
 - fix image exporting
 - json config file
