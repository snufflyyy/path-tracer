# todo list

 - use a faster library for writing png files or use a fast zlib compress function (see std_image_write.h lines 17-21 for more info)
 - clean up the #includes
 - add more hittables (such as planes, or triangles)
 - if i add a triangle hittable, try to add meshes using BVH or something like that
 - direct light sampling possibly
 - refactor / scan through all my code to make sure its not shitty

# version 0.5

 - add scene system (saving and loading, maybe json?)
 - better material system (like the one in raytracing in one weekend), that is easy to extend
