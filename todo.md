# todo list

 - use a faster library for writing png files or use a fast zlib compress function (see std_image_write.h lines 17-21 for more info)
 - create some sort of logging subsystem that lets me log errors
 - optimize the Color to ColorRGB to be as fast as possible
 - possibly instead of a quad, calculate a triangle that would fill the screen and render the texture on that
