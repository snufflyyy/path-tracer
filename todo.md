# todo list

 - use a faster library for writing png files or use a fast zlib compress function (see std_image_write.h lines 17-21 for more info)
 - clean up the #includes
 - add more hittables (such as planes, or triangles)
 - direct light sampling possibly
 - redo and split up all the current ui's sections into their own imgui windows
 - refactor / scan through all my code to make sure its not shitty
